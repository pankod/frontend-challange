We are a young and innovative software development house located in the heart of beautiful İstanbul. We leverage agile methodologies, software life cycle best practices and cutting edge technology to deliver perfect solutions reflecting our passion for software development. 

We care about our company culture and invest people to create best teams of highly skilled developers.

## About the challenge

This is a basic test, in which you should be able to write a React app, using the provided screens as reference. You’ll need to get some JSON content, filter, sort and search the data and print it on view.

Although this is a basic exercise, we’ll be looking for simple, well-designed and tested code in the submission.

## Task

Using the provided screens as a reference, you’ll need to build a set of React components to render the app. You’ll also need to request a JSON feed, filter that data, and use the relevant fields. 

We have provided mock movie data as a JSON file. While requesting JSON feed, we also ask you to use React Query for storing incoming data. So this stored data will be used when you build the app and the components.

Use the returned data to display a page of results that matches the given design.

Please include a README with setup instructions, and any tests or other documentation you created as part of your solution.

We also recommend you to use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)  in order not to make basic configuration yourself.

You can use frameworks or packages as long as you can explain to us why you chose them.

## Design

<div>
  <img src="./screenshots/home.png"  height="300" >
  <img src="./screenshots/movies.png" height="300" >
 </div>
<br>

We've provided a screen [designs](./design) for desktop version. You should follow design measurements in sketch file. 

There's no screens designed for the mobile version, but if you build a responsive app it's a big plus. 

If you don't have licence for sketch visit their [official](https://www.sketch.com/) website to get a free trial version.

We encourage you to use latest CSS techniques(like flex-box) and responsive design approach.

<br>

## Details
You will need to build the following 3 pages with React:

- A “Home” page
- A “Series” page
- A “Movies” page


#### Home Page

This will be your index.html screen. You will need to display 2 tiles, which link to the “Series” page and the “Movies” page.

#### Series and Movies Pages

For each page you will need to fetch JSON feed in feed/sample.json, then:

- Display the first 21 entries.
- Where the entry has a releaseYear attribute value >= 2010.
- Sorted by the title attribute value in ascending alphanumeric order.

 For the Search function:
 - It should filter the title attribute value of movies and series
 - It should start to filter after typing 3 characters.

 For Movies and Series pages there will be a dropdown list which has options of:

- Sort by year in descending order.
- Sort by year in ascending order.
- Sort by title in descending order.
- Sort by title in ascending order.



For the “Series” page filter on:

- Where the entry has a programType attribute value of series

For the “Movies” page filter on:
- Where the entry has a programType attribute value of movie


The attributes you should use to display the entries are:

- title
- images → Poster Art → url

You will also need to handle the loading and error states, of fetching the JSON feed:

- Check the design file for loading and error screens.

Please create components for each part of the page (eg. header, content, footer, etc).

You can assume that you do not have to support legacy browsers without features such as fetch or flexbox.

## Nice to have 

These are not obligatory but big plus if you implement. Here's few suggestion of things we'd like to see:

- Implement solution in TypeScript.

- Implement solution in Next.js.

- Responsive design for mobile device.

- Showing your work through your Git commit history.

- Production grade code (clean, maintainable, reusable code)

- Implement unit tests with Jest & React Testing Library.

- Prefer to use a css methodology, such as BEM.
